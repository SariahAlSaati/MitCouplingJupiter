# MIT Coupling study at Jupiter

This repository contains the implementation of the method used for the study of the Magnetosphere-Ionosphere-Thermosphere coupling at Jupiter using data from NASA's Juno mission.

This work have been done during the master internship of Sariah Al Saati and Noé Clément at Institut de Recherche en Astrophysique et Planétologie (IRAP) in Toulouse, under the supervision of Michel Blanc and Nicolas André, in 2021.

The code has been partly adapted from the code of Yuxian Wang written in IDL written during his PhD at IRAP.
